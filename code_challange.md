Implementing a "Quick Coding Challenge" feature would be a fantastic addition to "Interview Hero"! It caters to users who want rapid, focused practice on specific algorithms or data structure problems without the full setup of a multi-question mock interview.

Here's a breakdown of how you could implement this feature:

**I. Core Concept & User Flow:**

1.  **Trigger:** User clicks "Start Quick Coding Challenge" (e.g., from the Interview Hub).
2.  **Challenge Selection (Optional):**
    *   **Random:** The system picks a random coding challenge from a predefined pool or based on a very general category (e.g., "arrays," "strings," "easy difficulty").
    *   **Category/Difficulty Selection:** User briefly selects a category (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming) and/or difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
3.  **Challenge Interface:**
    *   A dedicated, focused UI.
    *   Displays the problem statement clearly.
    *   Provides a code editor (Monaco) pre-configured for a common language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, or user's preferred if known).
    *   Option to run code against predefined test cases.
    *   Option to submit the solution.
    *   (Optional) A timer.
4.  **Evaluation (Simplified or Full AI):**
    *   **Option A (Test Case Based):** Primarily evaluates based on correctness against hidden test cases.
    *   **Option B (AI Code Review Lite):** Sends the code to Gemini (or another code analysis AI) for feedback on style, efficiency (conceptual), and potential bugs, in addition to test case results. This is more complex.
    *   **Option C (Solution Comparison):** If you have canonical solutions, compare the user's output or approach (requires advanced parsing or AI).
5.  **Feedback & Next Steps:**
    *   Show test case results (pass/fail).
    *   Display AI feedback if implemented.
    *   Option to see a solution or hints.
    *   Option to try another quick challenge.

**II. Database Schema Changes (Potential):**

1.  **`coding_challenges` Table:**
    *   `id`: UUID, Primary Key
    *   `title`: TEXT (e.g., "Two Sum," "Reverse a String")
    *   `problem_statement`: TEXT (Markdown enabled preferably)
    *   `difficulty`: TEXT (e.g., 'easy', 'medium', 'hard')
    *   `category`: TEXT (e.g., 'arrays', 'strings', 'graphs', 'dynamic_programming')
    *   `default_language`: TEXT (e.g., 'javascript', 'python')
    *   `initial_code_snippet`: TEXT (Boilerplate code for the user to start with for each language)
    *   `created_at`, `updated_at`
    *   `source` (optional, e.g. 'leetcode_easy_1', 'custom')

2.  **`coding_challenge_test_cases` Table:**
    *   `id`: UUID, Primary Key
    *   `challenge_id`: UUID, FK to `coding_challenges.id`
    *   `input`: JSONB (e.g., `{"args": [ [1,2,3], 5 ] }` or a structured representation)
    *   `expected_output`: JSONB (e.g., `[0, 2]` or `true`)
    *   `is_hidden`: BOOLEAN (some test cases might be hidden from the user)
    *   `explanation` (optional, TEXT): Why this test case is important.

3.  **`user_coding_challenge_submissions` Table:**
    *   `id`: UUID, Primary Key
    *   `user_id`: UUID, FK to `users.id`
    *   `challenge_id`: UUID, FK to `coding_challenges.id`
    *   `language`: TEXT (language used by user)
    *   `code_submission`: TEXT (the user's code)
    *   `submitted_at`: TIMESTAMPTZ
    *   `status`: TEXT (e.g., 'pending', 'passed', 'failed_tests', 'error_compiling')
    *   `test_case_results`: JSONB (e.g., `[{"test_case_id": "uuid", "passed": true, "actual_output": "..."}]`)
    *   `ai_feedback_id`: UUID, FK to `ai_analysis_results` (if you reuse that table for code feedback, or create a new `ai_code_feedback` table) - Optional for AI code review.

    **RLS for these tables:**
    *   `coding_challenges`, `coding_challenge_test_cases`: Generally readable by all authenticated users. Inserts/updates by admins.
    *   `user_coding_challenge_submissions`: Users can create their own, read their own. Admins can read all.

**III. Backend Implementation (Server Actions / Route Handlers):**

1.  **Fetch Challenge Action/Route:**
    *   Input: Optional category, difficulty.
    *   Logic: Selects a challenge (randomly or based on criteria) from `coding_challenges`. Fetches its details and *non-hidden* test cases (or just inputs for non-hidden ones).
    *   Output: Challenge data (problem statement, initial snippet, inputs for visible test cases).

2.  **Run Code Action/Route (Most Complex Part):**
    *   **This requires a Code Execution Sandbox.** Running arbitrary user code directly on your server is a massive security risk.
    *   **Options for Code Execution Sandboxes:**
        *   **Judge0 API (Popular):** Supports many languages, has free/paid tiers. You send code, language, input -> get output, errors, execution time, memory.
        *   **Piston API:** Another open-source option you can self-host or find hosted instances.
        *   **AWS Lambda / Google Cloud Functions with Docker:** You can build your own secure execution environment. More setup.
        *   **Supabase Edge Functions with Deno (Limited):** Deno has some sandboxing, but executing arbitrary code for many languages is complex and risky. Better for specific, controlled tasks. Not ideal as a general-purpose code runner for user submissions.
    *   **Input to this action/route:** `challenge_id`, `user_code`, `language`, `test_case_id` (if running one specific test case) or `run_all_test_cases: true`.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Securely send the `user_code` and `test_case.input` to the chosen code execution sandbox.
        2.  Receive `stdout`, `stderr`, execution time, memory from the sandbox.
        3.  Compare `stdout` with `test_case.expected_output`.
        4.  Store the submission in `user_coding_challenge_submissions` with results.
        5.  (Optional) If all tests pass and you want AI code review, trigger another action/call to Gemini with the user's code and problem statement for qualitative feedback.
    *   **Output:** Test case results (pass/fail, actual output, expected output), compilation errors, runtime errors.

3.  **AI Code Feedback Action/Route (Optional):**
    *   Input: `user_code_submission_id` (or `user_code`, `language`, `problem_statement`).
    *   Prompt Gemini: "Review this [language] code for the problem: '[problem_statement]'. Provide feedback on correctness (if not covered by test cases), efficiency, code style, best practices, and potential bugs. User's code: ```[user_code]```"
    *   Store feedback, possibly in `ai_analysis_results` (if you adapt it) or a new `ai_code_feedback` table.

**IV. Frontend Implementation (`QuickChallengeInterface.tsx` - Client Component):**

This would be a new page or a modal.

*   **State Management:**
    *   `currentChallenge` (object)
    *   `userCode` (string)
    *   `selectedLanguage` (string)
    *   `testResults` (array of objects)
    *   `aiCodeFeedback` (object or string)
    *   `isLoadingChallenge`, `isRunningCode`, `isLoadingFeedback`
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   **Problem Statement Display:** Render markdown for rich formatting.
    *   **Monaco Code Editor:**
        *   Bound to `userCode` and `selectedLanguage`.
        *   `onChange` updates `userCode`.
    *   **Language Selector:** Allows user to pick from languages supported by your sandbox.
    *   **"Run Code" Button:**
        *   Sends `userCode`, `selectedLanguage`, and current challenge's visible test case inputs to your "Run Code" backend endpoint.
        *   Displays output and pass/fail for visible test cases.
    *   **"Submit" Button (Optional, if different from "Run Code"):**
        *   Runs code against all test cases (including hidden ones).
        *   Updates status in `user_coding_challenge_submissions`.
        *   Potentially triggers AI code review.
    *   **Test Case Results Display:** Show input, expected output, actual output, pass/fail for each run test case.
    *   **AI Feedback Display:** If implemented, show the AI's qualitative review.
    *   **"View Solution" / "Hints" Button (Optional).**
    *   **"Next Challenge" Button.**
    *   **(Optional) Timer.**

**Example Workflow for "Run Code":**

1.  User types code in Monaco.
2.  User clicks "Run Code".
3.  `QuickChallengeInterface.tsx` calls a server action (or `/api/...` route) `runCodeAction(challengeId, userCode, language, testType: 'visible')`.
4.  `runCodeAction`:
    *   Fetches *visible* test cases for `challengeId`.
    *   For each visible test case:
        *   Sends `userCode`, `language`, `testCase.input` to Judge0 (or other sandbox).
        *   Gets `output`, `error`, `status`.
        *   Compares `output` with `testCase.expectedOutput`.
    *   Returns an array of results for visible test cases to the client.
5.  `QuickChallengeInterface.tsx` displays these results.

**Simplifications for a First Version:**

*   **Predefined Challenges:** Start with a small, fixed set of coding challenges stored directly in your frontend code or fetched from a simple JSON file/Supabase table, instead of a full admin system to add them.
*   **No AI Code Review Initially:** Focus on test case execution first. AI code review adds significant complexity to prompting and result parsing.
*   **Limited Languages:** Support only 1-2 popular languages initially (e.g., JavaScript, Python) to simplify sandbox integration.
*   **Basic Test Case Runner:** "Run Code" executes against all visible test cases. No separate "Submit" for hidden ones initially.

**Security is Paramount for Code Execution:**
**Never attempt to execute user-submitted code directly on your own servers without a proper, battle-tested sandboxing solution like Judge0 or Piston.** This is a very significant security risk.

This feature is a substantial addition. I recommend breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces:
1.  Data model for challenges and test cases.
2.  UI for displaying a challenge and the code editor.
3.  Integration with a code execution sandbox (this is the biggest technical hurdle).
4.  Logic for running against test cases and displaying results.
5.  (Later) AI code review integration.
6.  (Later) System for users to select challenges by category/difficulty.
